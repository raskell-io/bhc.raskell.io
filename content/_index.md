## Get Started

Install bhc and compile your first Haskell project.

```bash
# Install bhc
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raskell-io/bhc/main/install.sh | sh

# Compile a project
cd my-haskell-project
bhc build

# Run it
bhc run
```

That's it. Fast, incremental compilation with zero configuration.
